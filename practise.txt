  loop to start of code
  else do nothing
Print "SECOND NUMBER"

User1 plus User2 = Output
Print OutPut

--TASK THREE--  Get an unknown amount of numbers from the user and add them together, print out the result.

Variable TOTAL

start loop
Get user input 
  if user input has letters or symbles

variable UserN
variable RandomN
variable OUTPUT

get user input and set UserN
   if user input has letters or symbles
  then print "ONLY NUMBERS"
  loop to start of code
  else do nothing
pick random number between 0 and user input and set RandomN

UserN plus RandomN = OUTPUT
print OUTPUT
